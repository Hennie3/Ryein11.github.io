            <h2>Past</h2>
            <p>From the moment we started talking, I knew I had found someone special. Although I didn’t realize it at first, as we got to know each other, I realized how amazing you are. Your way of looking at the world, your optimism, and authenticity have inspired me in a way I could never have imagined. It's incredible how, despite the distance, you can brighten my days just by thinking of you</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page">
            <h2>Present</h2>
            <p>I truly feel happy to have met you. Despite the distance, every day you are in my life becomes more special. Although we are far apart, your presence still has an incredible impact on me. There is nothing that brings me more joy than the moments we share, whether through words or those little moments that bring a smile to my face, even from afar</p>

        </div>
        <div class="page">
            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>I imagine a future where we can create memories together, where each day is filled with laughter, adventures, and meaningful moments. I would like our connection to deepen over time, and for us to share our dreams and desires, supporting each other every step of the way</p>
